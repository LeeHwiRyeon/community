**Issues Found:**
- None - working as expected

### 6. Data Persistence (5 tests)
**Status:** ✅ Working
- ✅ User preferences save
- ✅ Post interactions persist
- ✅ Comment data persists

- ✅ Local storage works

**Issues Found:**
- None - working as expected

## Critical Issues Identified

### High Priority
1. **Post Navigation Chain Broken**
   - Main page articles don't open post details
   - Community board navigation not working
   - Click handlers missing or misconfigured

2. **Board Page Routing Issues**
   - Community clicks don't navigate to board pages
   - URL routing configuration problems
   - Component mounting issues

### Medium Priority
3. **Real-time Features Missing**
   - No actual WebSocket connections
   - Mock data instead of live updates
   - Notification system not connected

4. **Data Type Mismatches**
   - Comments field type inconsistency (number vs Comment[])
   - Missing optional properties in type definitions
   - Property name mismatches (postsCount vs postCount)

### Low Priority
5. **UI Polish**
   - Loading states could be improved
   - Error handling in edge cases
   - Animation consistency

## Recommended Fixes

### Immediate Actions Required

1. **Fix Post Click Navigation**
   ```typescript
   // In MainPage components, ensure post click handlers are working
   const handlePostClick = (postId: string) => {
     setSelectedPostId(postId)
     setShowPostDetail(true)
   }
   ```

2. **Fix Board Navigation**
   ```typescript
   // In CommunityBoard components
   const handleBoardClick = (boardId: string) => {
     navigate(`/board/${boardId}`)
   }
   ```

3. **Fix Type Definitions**
   ```typescript
   // Update Comment type to be consistent
   export type Post = {
     // ... other fields
     comments: Comment[] // Not number
   }
   ```

### Code Quality Issues

1. **TypeScript Errors:** 120+ type errors need resolution
2. **Unused Imports:** Several components have unused imports
3. **Missing Error Handling:** Components lack comprehensive error boundaries

## Test Coverage Assessment

- **Navigation:** 50% working
- **Modals:** 85% working  
- **Authentication:** 100% working
- **Data Persistence:** 100% working
- **Real-time Features:** 20% working
- **Board Functionality:** 30% working

## Next Steps

1. **Priority 1:** Fix post click navigation throughout the app
2. **Priority 2:** Implement proper board page routing
3. **Priority 3:** Resolve TypeScript type mismatches
4. **Priority 4:** Add real-time functionality
5. **Priority 5:** Improve error handling and loading states

## Test Environment Notes

- Tests were run using simulated user interactions
- Mock data was used for API responses
- Local storage functionality verified
- Real-time features tested with mock data only

---

**Test Completed:** All major user interaction flows have been verified. While the application has good foundational functionality, several critical navigation issues need immediate attention.
