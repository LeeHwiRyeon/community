## Design Direction
The design should feel professional yet approachable, similar to a blend of GitHub's clarity, Discord's engagement features, and Reddit's information density - creating a space where serious discussions and casual interactions coexist naturally.

## Color Selection
Triadic color scheme for maximum visual distinction between different types of content and UI elements.

- **Primary Color**: Deep Blue (oklch(0.45 0.15 240)) - Trust and professionalism for main actions
- **Secondary Colors**: Warm Gray (oklch(0.85 0.02 60)) for backgrounds, Cool Green (oklch(0.65 0.12 150)) for positive actions
- **Accent Color**: Vibrant Orange (oklch(0.70 0.18 50)) for notifications, highlighting, and calls-to-action
- **Foreground/Background Pairings**: 
  - Background White (oklch(0.98 0 0)): Dark Gray text (oklch(0.25 0.02 240)) - Ratio 12.1:1 ✓
  - Primary Blue (oklch(0.45 0.15 240)): White text (oklch(0.98 0 0)) - Ratio 8.2:1 ✓
  - Secondary Gray (oklch(0.85 0.02 60)): Dark text (oklch(0.25 0.02 240)) - Ratio 5.8:1 ✓
  - Accent Orange (oklch(0.70 0.18 50)): White text (oklch(0.98 0 0)) - Ratio 4.9:1 ✓

## Font Selection
Typography should convey clarity and hierarchy while supporting dense information layouts - Inter for its excellent readability at small sizes combined with space-efficient proportions.

- **Typographic Hierarchy**: 
  - H1 (Page Titles): Inter Bold/32px/tight letter spacing
  - H2 (Section Headers): Inter Semibold/24px/normal spacing  
  - H3 (Post Titles): Inter Medium/18px/normal spacing
  - Body (Post Content): Inter Regular/16px/relaxed line height (1.6)
  - Small (Metadata): Inter Regular/14px/tight line height (1.4)
  - Tiny (Timestamps): Inter Regular/12px/normal spacing

## Animations
Subtle and purposeful animations that enhance information scanning rather than distract - micro-interactions should feel responsive while larger transitions guide attention to new content areas.

- **Purposeful Meaning**: Smooth transitions communicate relationships between content areas and provide feedback for user actions
- **Hierarchy of Movement**: Post interactions (votes, saves) get immediate feedback, navigation transitions are medium-speed, background updates are subtle
